## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset used includes information such as:

- **State_Name**: The state in India.
- **Crop_Type** and **Crop**: The type of crop and the specific crop being grown.
- **Soil and Climate Data**: Various factors affecting crop growth.
- **Production_in_tons**: The target variable, representing the crop yield in tons.

## üîÅ Model Comparisons

### 1. **Random Forest Regressor**
Random Forest was trained on the dataset and tested against the hold-out test data. It consistently produced good results with strong predictive accuracy and was selected as the best model based on evaluation metrics.

### 2. **XGBoost Regressor**
XGBoost was trained and tested on the same data. It showed competitive performance but was outperformed by Random Forest in terms of error metrics.

### 3. **LightGBM Regressor**
LightGBM provided reliable predictions as well, though it did not outperform Random Forest after all evaluations.

## üîÉ Data Transformations

- **One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Variables**:  
   Categorical variables such as `State_Name`, `Crop_Type`, and `Crop` were one-hot encoded to convert them into a numerical format suitable for model training.

- **Box-Cox Transformation for Numerical Variables**:  
   A Box-Cox transformation was applied to numerical attributes to stabilize variance and normalize the data, improving model performance. This transformation is especially useful for handling skewed data distributions.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Impact of Transformations**: The Box-Cox transformation helped improve the accuracy of the models, particularly for Random Forest.
- **Result**: The final model is capable of accurately predicting crop yields based on a variety of input features, providing valuable insights for farmers.
